# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was asked by Twitter:

# A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards.
# Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

# Example:
# Input: "banana"
# Output: "anana"

# Input: "million"
# Output: "illi"
# class Solution:
#     def longestPalindrome(self, s):
#       # Fill this in.

# # Test program
# s = "tracecars"
# print(str(Solution().longestPalindrome(s)))
# # racecar


class Solution:
    def checkPalindrome(str):
        # reversing a string in python to get the reversed string
        # This is extended slice syntax.
        # It works by doing [begin:end:step] - by leaving begin and end off and specifying a step of -1,
        # it reverses a string.
        reversedString = str[::-1]
        if (str == reversedString):
            return true
        else:
            return false

    def longestPalindrome(str):
        while (index > str.length):
            while ():
                pass
